sc_spintax
==========

Simple implementation of "spintax," a text generation mechanism often abused for text farms and spam



Text farms and spam?  Srsly?
----------------------------

So like, it's also got legit uses, right?  And I think it's pretty fun.  I've always loved text generation and other horseshit approaches to fighting the Turing Test using only your middle fingers.  They're great.  [The Postmodernism Generator](http://www.elsewhere.org/pomo/) is probably my favorite of these (reload it a few times,) though I also miss SMAUG (can't find an active link, sry,) [chatbots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA), and so on.

Then I saw the [spam script accidentally posted at AlexKing.org](http://alexking.org/blog/2013/12/22/spam-comment-generator-script), and I knew that I had to act. :+1:



Yeah but what the hell
----------------------

Dude this stuff is all over the 'net already; just google it.  I'm not enabling any blackhats.  I am, however, enabling new usage among people who didn't know about this stuff.



Don't you usually write useful things?
--------------------------------------

What?  Lol, no.

&hellip; but this one could be.

So for example, I kind of want to use this to do video game dialogue.
